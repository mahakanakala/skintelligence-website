    question:
      "Is there a correlation between the number of toxins & price of the product?",
    answer: "The average cost difference between toxin-containing and non-toxin-containing products in the cosmetics industry implies a growing emphasis on product safety, consumer awareness, and the willingness of individuals to invest in safer alternatives. It indicates a shift towards cleaner and more conscious beauty choices among consumers.",

    question:
      "Is there a correlation between the brand prestige & the number of toxins?",
    answer: "The negative correlation of -0.35 between brand prestige and normalized toxicity in the cosmetic industry suggests that, on average, brands with higher prestige tend to have lower levels of toxicity** in their products. This correlation reflects the *growing consumer demand for safer and more environmentally friendly products*. It indicates that prestigious brands are likely prioritizing the development of safer and less toxic cosmetic products to meet consumer expectations.",
